js mutiple callback function

TODO:
1.  split file

2.  convert video

TESTING:
1.  setup testing structure for db, frontend js and backend controllers

2.  test with large file.
    currently has been tested with:  mp3 44s 691kb

    api sends file and receives result longer than response timeout
      idea: frontend adds progress bar for showing backend running process status
