TODO:

https://blog.robseder.com/2013/10/18/executing-a-long-running-process-from-a-web-page/

2.  delete the file from upload folder once translation finished

3.  split file listing view(translated vs non-translated)
    sorting files based on timestamp

4.  Google API English/French   

FUTURE:
1.  split file

2.  convert video

TESTING:
1.  setup testing structure for db, frontend js and backend controllers

2.  test with large file.
    currently has been tested with:  mp3 44s 691kb

    api sends file and receives result longer than response timeout
      idea: frontend adds progress bar for showing backend running process status
